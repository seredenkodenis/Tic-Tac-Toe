# Tic-Tac-Toe
 Just ordinary tic-tac-toe written on Java. This is command version of tic-tac-toe.
 
# Game rules
 - The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
 - You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
 - The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
 - When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
 
# How I can put X or O?
We have a field of view:<br><br>
| 1 | 2 | 3 |<br>
| 4 | 5 | 6 |<br>
| 7 | 8 | 9 |<br><br>
So if you want to put the badge in any cell, just enter its number.<br>
See that the cell should not be occupied!
